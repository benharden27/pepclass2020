# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the PEP Class 2020. The goal of this class is to prepare students to address questions pertinent to Global Climate Change within the Ocean and Environmental Sciences. The course will run over four weeks from June 1 to June 26 and complements a research internship with a scientist from the Woods Hole Science community by building a foundation of concepts and skills required to be a successful researcher.
