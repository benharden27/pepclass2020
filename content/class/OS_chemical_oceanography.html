<p>Chemical Oceanography is concerned with the the study of the interaction of dissolved ions, molecules, gasses in the ocean. This is a diverse field and we will be covering the basics of macronutrients, oxygen and carbon in this class. This will be a necessarily broad overview.</p>

<p>Read the following from <a href="https://www.reefimages.com/oceansci.php">Segar</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean4Chap05.pdf">Chapter 5</a>:
<ul>
<li>The Dissolving Power of Water (pg. 94-95)</li>
<li>Sources and Sinks of Chemicals Dissolved in Seawater (pg. 95-96)</li>
<li>Salinity (pg. 96-97)</li>
<li>Dissolved Chemicals in Seawater (pg. 97-101)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Read <a href="/docs/ocean-carbon-pump_ScientificItems_BD-2.pdf">The Ocean: A Carbon Pump</a> which talks about the various ways in which carbon dioxide gets from the surface to the deep ocean including through the photosynthesis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch this short video about the Biological Pump</p></li>

<li>Read <a href="/docs/Current-Ocean_Acidification_Issue.pdf">The Threat of Acidification to Ocean Ecosystems</a>, which introduces Ocean Acidification and the threats it poses.</li>

<h2 id="oceanic-pumps">Oceanic Pumps</h2>
<p>The following are idealized profiles of Carbon, Oxygen and Nutrients from somewhere in the ocean.</p>
<p><img src="/images/OceanSolutes18IV.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Q: Describe the vertical distribution in the three properties
<ul>
<li>Where do the values go up and down?</li>
<li>Where are they minimum and maximum?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Q: How would you explain these patterns in relation to the Oceanic Pumps?</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch this video I made about deep water formation in the North Atlantic (itâ€™s from a longer series based on a expedition to the east coast of Greenland):</p>

<p>Using this video and remembering the relationship between temperature and the ability of gas to dissolve in the ocean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q: Why does oxygen not deplete all the way to zero in the deep ocean?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ocean-acidification">Ocean Acidification</h2>
<p>The following is a time series of carbon dioxide concentrations from the longest operating measurement station at <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/">Mauna Loa</a>, Hawaii</p>
<p><img src="/images/manua_loa.png" /></p>
<p>The red data are atmospheric CO_2_ concentrations, the orange is oceanic carbon dioxide measurements, and the blue is the oceanic pH.</p>
<ul>
<li>Q: Describe the patterns in each line and the sequence of events that relates them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a map of the changes in ocean acidity</p>
<p><img src="/images/Historical_Changes_in_Ocean_Acidity.jpg" /></p>
<p>The orange areas are the places that have seen the greatest reduction in pH (or greatest increase in acidity)</p>
<ul>
<li>Q: Which areas have seen the largest reduction in pH - is there a general pattern across the globe?</li>
<li>Q: How might you explain the patterns you see in this map?</li>
</ul>
