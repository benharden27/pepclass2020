2. Read the following from [Segar](https://www.reefimages.com/oceansci.php):

* [Chapter 12](https://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean4Chap12.pdf): only pg 285 - 296.
* [Critical Concept](https://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean4CritCon.pdf) 14, which covers light, nutrients and photosynthesis in the ocean.

3. Listen to this podcast about putting excess nitrogen into a local watershed:

## Vertical Distribution of Chlorophyll

Below are typical vertical profiles of light and nutrients in the ocean.

![](/images/light_nutrients.jpg)

* Q1: Describe the patterns that you see in each - why do they behave the way they do?

* Q2: Given that phytoplankton need both light and nutrients to grow, can you hypothesize the vertical distribution of phytoplankton for these profiles?

## Seasonal Cycle

We saw in our class on Temperature and Salinity, that the mixed-layer at mid-latitudes increases in depth during the winter due to strong, cold winds, before shoaling in the spring and into the summer when a strong thermocline (pycnocline) is developed.

* Q3: How do you think this will affect the availability of nutrients in the surface water over the course of the year?

Below is some data from the [Ocean Observatories Initiative](https://oceanobservatories.org/), a massive undertaking to collect data from around the globe throughout the year. Shown in the three plots are surface concentrations of Chlorophyll-a, Oxygen, and Nitrate from summer 2018 to summer 2019.

```{r}
ts <- read_csv("data/ooi.csv")
ctd <- read_csv("data/ctd.csv") %>%
  filter(dep <= 1000)

vars<-c(fluorometric_chlorophyll_a="Chlorophyll-a (mg/L)",
        dissolved_oxygen="Dissolved Oxygen (umol/kg)",
        nitrate_concentration="Nitrate (umol/L)")

ggplot(ts,aes(time,value))+
  geom_point(size = .3) +
  facet_wrap(~factor(key,names(vars)),ncol=1,scales="free_y",strip.position = "left",labeller=as_labeller(vars))+
  labs(x=NULL,y=NULL)+
  scale_x_datetime(date_breaks="2 months", date_labels=("%m/%y"))+
  theme_bw() +
  theme(strip.placement = "outside",
        strip.background = element_blank())
```

* Q4: How does the seasonal cycle in nitrate compare with your prediction above?

* Q5: Describe the seasonal cycle in phytoplankton growth - How does this relate to the seasonal cycle in oxygen?

* Q6: What patterns and inter-relationships can you see on time scales of less that a month?
