Chemical Oceanography is concerned with the the study of the interaction of dissolved ions, molecules, gasses in the ocean. This is a diverse field and we will be covering the basics of macronutrients, oxygen and carbon in this class. This will be a necessarily broad overview.

# Reading

Read the following from [Segar](https://www.reefimages.com/oceansci.php):

- [Chapter 5](https://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean4Chap05.pdf): 
  * The Dissolving Power of Water (pg. 94-95)
  * Sources and Sinks of Chemicals Dissolved in Seawater (pg. 95-96)
  * Salinity (pg. 96-97)
  * Dissolved Chemicals in Seawater (pg. 97-101)

- Read [The Ocean: A Carbon Pump](/docs/ocean-carbon-pump_ScientificItems_BD-2.pdf) which talks about the various ways in which carbon dioxide gets from the surface to the deep ocean including through the photosynthesis of [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton).

- Watch this short video about the Biological Pump

- Read [The Threat of Acidification to Ocean Ecosystems](/docs/Current-Ocean_Acidification_Issue.pdf), which introduces Ocean Acidification and the threats it poses.

## Oceanic Pumps

The following are idealized profiles of Carbon, Oxygen and Nutrients from somewhere in the ocean.

* Q: Describe the vertical distribution in the three properties 
    + Where do the values go up and down?
    + Where are they minimum and maximum?
* Q: How would you explain these patterns in relation to the Oceanic Pumps?

Watch this video I made about deep water formation in the North Atlantic (it's from a longer series based on a expedition to the east coast of Greenland):

Using this video and remembering the relationship between temperature and the ability of gas to dissolve in the ocean:

* Q: Why does oxygen not deplete all the way to zero in the deep ocean?

## Ocean Acidification

The following is a time series of carbon dioxide concentrations from the longest operating measurement station at [Mauna Loa](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/), Hawaii

![](/images/manua_loa.png)

The red data are atmospheric CO_2_ concentrations, the orange is oceanic carbon dioxide measurements, and the blue is the oceanic pH.

* Q: Describe the patterns in each line and the sequence of events that relates them.

Below is a map of the changes in ocean acidity 

![](/images/Historical_Changes_in_Ocean_Acidity.jpg)

The orange areas are the places that have seen the greatest reduction in pH (or greatest increase in acidity)

* Q: Which areas have seen the largest reduction in pH - is there a general pattern across the globe?
* Q: How might you explain the patterns you see in this map?
