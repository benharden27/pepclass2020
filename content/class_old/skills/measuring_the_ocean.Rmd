### How we measure Temperature and Salinity

The basic tool for measuring the temperature and salinity of the ocean is the [CTD](https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/explore/instruments/instruments-sensors-samplers/conductivity-temperature-depth-ctd-sensors/) (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth) device which we lower from the side of a ship to record a vertical trace (or profile) of the ocean.

The following video came from a cruise in the North Atlantic in 2012.
