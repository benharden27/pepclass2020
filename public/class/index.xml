      <description> How we measure Temperature and Salinity The basic tool for measuring the temperature and salinity of the ocean is the CTD (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth) device which we lower from the side of a ship to record a vertical trace (or profile) of the ocean.
The following video came from a cruise in the North Atlantic in 2012.

      <description>Chemical Oceanography is concerned with the the study of the interaction of dissolved ions, molecules, gasses in the ocean. This is a diverse field and we will be covering the basics of macronutrients, oxygen and carbon in this class. This will be a necessarily broad overview.

      <description>Reading You should read Sections 3.1 to 3.6 (and skim the rest) of Chapter 3 of R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This should introduced you to the basic ideas behind ggplot and helped you create your first plots using their built-in data. ggplot is a powerful tool for producing elegant graphics and is relatively simple to use once you’ve mastered a few key ideas.</description>

      <description>Physical Oceanography is the study of how water moves. This includes ocean currents, waves and large scale ocean circulation. Some of the most fundamental ideas revolve around the key physical properties of the water: Temperature, Salinity and Density. We will explore these properties and how they allow or limit movement of water in the ocean.

      <description>Our goal in learning R is to introduce you to some skills in exploring oceanographic data in R. This will mainly involve plotting tools, but will also include some discussion of working with data sets.
NOTE: There is no exercise submission or Peer Discussion requirements for this work, but please reach out on the course Slack channel if you have any technical issues.
Why R? Perhaps the best place to start is to ask ourselves why we are choosing to use R.</description>
